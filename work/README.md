This directory contains temporary files used during the map conversion process.
   1) osmsplitmaps contains the input OSM PBF file split into smaller PBF files
   2) garminsplitmaps contains the split PBF files converted to Garmin image format
None of these files are configured in GIT as they are just temporary working files.
