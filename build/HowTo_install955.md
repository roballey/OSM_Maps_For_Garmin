Use script "build/install955.sh" or old manual GUI way from below:

Copy the .img file file from either `maps/routable` or `maps/nonrouteable` to the 955 `Internal Storage/GARMIN` directory (I also renamed files to `nzroute.img`).
Must use nautilus file explorer and not command line as 955 is setup as MTP devices and not mass storage. (Now resolved)

Unplug 955.
955 reports 'loading maps'
