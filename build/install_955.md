Copy the .img file file from either `maps/routable` or `maps/nonrouteable` to the 955 `Internal Storage/GARMIN` directory (I also renamed files to `nzroute.img`).
Must use nautilus file explorer and not command line as 955 is setup as MTP devices and not mass storage.

Unplug 955.
955 reports 'loading maps'
Long press middle left button, select Map->Map Manager->`Maps for Garmin devices generated from OSM data`  (Can't deselect?)
